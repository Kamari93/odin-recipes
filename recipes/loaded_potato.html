    <h2>Crispy Skinned Twice Baked Potato With A Fluffy, Pillowy Interior</h2>
    <p>What better way to amp up the standard steak house side? By stuffing them full of cheese, sour cream and bacon of course!</p>
    <p>hese spuds, filled to the brim with your favorite potato toppings, can almost be a meal on their own, just like our bbq chicken twice-baked potatoes or taco stuffed sweet potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (4 servings):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly chopped chives</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced, white and green parts divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded Cheddar</li>
        <li>6 slices crispy bacon, crumbled</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Prick potatoes all over with a fork or sharp knife and wrap tightly in foil. Bake until soft, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Unwrap potatoes and cut lengthwise slits in the top of each. Carefully scoop out flesh from center of each potato into a medium bowl, then add butter, sour cream, chives, green onion whites, half the cheddar, and half the bacon. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon filling back into each potato, mounding it on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and return to oven until melted, about 5 minutes. Top with scallion greens and remaining bacon.</li>
    </ol>
